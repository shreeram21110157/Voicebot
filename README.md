# Voicebot
Rasa trained voice bot 

The idea of the project is to build a voice bot which recognizes when the user speaks and talks back using python library Speech Recognition . This is built on Rasa framework. We have train the model to search for responses after extracting the intention of the user. I contributed in training the rasa framework and searching in the internet if a pre trained response is not available.
